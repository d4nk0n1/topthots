== Frequently asked questions ==

= How to install the WordPress plugin ? =

Please refer to the [Installation tab](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/affil4you/installation/).

= How to configure the WordPress plugin ? =

1) The Configuration tab allows you to configure your affil4you account settings and activate the plugin.
In this tab you need to fill in your Affil4you activation key for the plugin to work. This key is 32 characters long. It is unique to your Affil4you account. It is therefore completely secure and only one person with access to your affil4you account can set up the plugin. This key is then automatically stored, and there is therefore no need to enter it again, even if you leave the page.
Don't forget to save your changes.

2) The Redirection mode tab allows you to configure redirected traffic and the target website for the redirection.

= What traffic to redirect ? =
All mobile traffic is redirected by the plugin by default. This is the recommended option for optimising your earnings with the plugin.
You can also redirect all your traffic via banners placed on your WordPress mobile blog. These banners, placed in the header or footer of your blog, are optimised and adapted to the mobile target or white label to which your traffic is redirected. Your hosting provider must allow outgoing http connections to prodaff.wister.biz.

= To which target/white label ? =
You are free to choose the target website for redirection.
The chosen target/white label is optimised: We select the best target website from all the target websites you create, i.e. the one that has converted the best during the previous month.
You can also select the target/white label of your choice. When you determine a target website, you are reminded of the redirection URL and can therefore verify your choice.

= Could I follow the plugin performances ? =
We have placed a default tracker ("WP"), which you can modify if necessary. This setting allows you to view the statistics of your WordPress plugin in order to compare and contrast the different traffic sources redirected to the same target website.

= My plugin does not seem activated after I have entered my activation key. What is happen ? =
The Wordpress plugin makes requests from server to server via cURL.
In order to guarantee the smooth running of the plugin, cURL must be active on the server where the WordPress site is stored. 
Furthermore, for an optimal functionality, the CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION option must be activated.

For any questions on how to install the WordPress Plugin, please contact Affil4You at sales@affil4you.com
